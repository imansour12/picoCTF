This may look complicated at first but it is actually pretty simple.
What you do is download the enc file and change its extension to .txt
You will get a weird chinese string
use python to .encode it in utf-16-be and you should get the flag.
Additionally, you may also use cyberchef on the magic setting to get the flag from the chinese string.
