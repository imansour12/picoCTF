First wget the source codefrom the exercise.
Go ahead and use the netcat command given to connect to the server.
You might notice that you do not have enough balance to buy an actual flag.
So how will we trick the system into thinking we have enough balance to buy a flag? 
If you look at the source code, you can see that the total cost is stored as a four byte integer.
The maximum value that a four byte integer can store is "2,147,483,647". After this, the number turns negative. I think you can see where we're going here. We need to input a value big enough so that it turns the price of the "Defintely not the flag Flag" into a ngative number. When we buy this, our balance will be not be decreased but increased. After this, we'll be able to afford the "1337 flag"

The value which we want to be negative is the total_cost variable. For this, we'll need a big enough number to multiply by 900 to surpass the 4 byte signed integer limit. For this I used the number 2388888.
Now, your balance will be very high and you can use that to choose the second option and buy your actual flag.
