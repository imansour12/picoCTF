First thing you'll wanna do is use the strings command to explore any printable characters in the file. 
However, the output will be kind of long so add a bigger than button (">") followed by something like output.txt
or the name of the file you want to output the results to. In the end your command will look something like this:
"strings <filename> > output.txt"

Use vim or your favorite text editor and search for pico which will show you our flag.
