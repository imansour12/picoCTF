First of all, visit the website given to you in the exercise.
From the weird name of the exercise we can assume that out flag is somewhere in the <head> part of the html.

So what we'll do is we will used the "curl" tool to make a get request for the webpage but we only want the head  back. 

So your command will look something like this:
curl -I <webpagegiveninthepicoctf>

You will get back the head and your flag will be in it
