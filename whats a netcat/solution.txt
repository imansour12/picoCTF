You may use netcat's cheat sheet which I have linked below to use netcat. However, you won't need most of the stuff on that sheet for this one.

Just use ths command : "nc <server adress> <port number>"
You will be provided with those pieces of data.

After this, the server should return your flag which you can simply copy paste into the submit box.
