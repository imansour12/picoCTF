In this exercise we have to convert a base-16 number which is another word for hexadecimal into a base-10 number which is another word for decimal. 
You can use an online coverter for this.
When you get the number make sure to format it in this way so that it is valid to be submitted as a flag:
picoCTF{<number you found>}
